# Census Data Analysis and Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Census data to gain valuable insights into demographic trends and other key statistics. Using Python's powerful data processing libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, the project implements the following:
- Descriptive analytics for understanding the dataset.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.


## Features

- **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizes the data with key metrics and visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Machine Learning**: Builds predictive models to classify or regress demographic-related variables.
- **Visualization**: Displays data insights using graphs and plots.
